#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

### Usage

1. Run the API server locally
```
$ git clone https://github.com/BaltasarAroso/mws-restaurant-stage-3.git
$ cd mws-restaurant-stage-3
$ node server
```

2. Clone the repository and get into the project folder
```
$ git clone https://github.com/BaltasarAroso/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git
$ cd mws-restaurant-stage-1
```

3. In the same directory, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`.

	If you have **Python 2.x**, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use).

	For **Python 3.x**, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`.


4. Finally, explore the site in `http://localhost:8000`

**Note:** `npm start` runs` gulp` automatically and join optimized files in `dist` folder, but that folder is already in repository so there's no need to run` npm start` again.
